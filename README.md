## Project Overview

This project is a deep dive into **bare-metal firmware engineering**, focusing on the STM32F108 microcontroller. By building everything from the ground up, this project serves as a foundational guide to understanding microcontrollers, bridging the gap between hardware architecture and low-level C programming. \
**The project demonstrates embedded firmware development concepts including:**

- STM32 Architecture
- Boot Process & Startup Code
- Linker Scripts
- Build Systems
- Register-Level Programming
- Learning how to make your own RTOS in STM32

## Features

**In this projects, we will dive into peripherals of STM32, including:**

- GPIO: Write, read, set pins
- TIMER: From PWM to making delay function using TIMER
- USART: Recieve and Sending strings
- I2C: Connect to OLED, recieve and sending packets
- ADC: Reading and converting raw data from sensors
- And many more......

**Beside that, we will learn how to use `Systick`, consist of:**

- How to make `delay` function
- Learn how to make a custom RTOS from scheduling to making `OS_Delay()`

## Prerequisites & Tools

To build and flash this project, you will need the following tools:

- **Compiler:** [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm) (`arm-none-eabi-gcc`)
- **Build System:** `Make`
- **Flashing/Debugging:** OpenOCD & ST-Link v2 (or your preferred debugger)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KimThanhNguyen-hcmus/Bare_Metal_Coding_Stm32.git
   cd Bare_Metal_Coding_Stm32
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make all
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   mingw32-make
   ```
3. Flash the firmware to the board:
   ```bash
   make flash
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   mingw32-make flash
   ```

## Developer's Diary
